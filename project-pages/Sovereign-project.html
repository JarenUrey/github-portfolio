		  <div class="body-text">Peter Smith had been working on the idea of Sovereign for years. Initially he was going to adapt the story into either a movie or a graphic novel, before he settled on wanting to adapt it into a game. He serves has the story writer and lead desginer for Sovereign.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Being a really small team and having a lot of responsibilities did help broaden my techincal skills that I otherwise would not have had to learn. Which I think grants a nice perspective of what it all takes to build a game, that otherwise a developer in a specailized role would not have had.</div>
		  <div class="body-text">As of right now, our main goal is to get a presentable product to show to producers by the end of the year. Once I finish up college and hopefully get funding for the game, we will be moving into fullscale development with bringing this project to life.</div>
